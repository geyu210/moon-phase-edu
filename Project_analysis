🌕 Moon Phase Simulator (/moon)
A fully functional interactive physics-based simulation.

Dual Views:
God Mode (Top-down): Shows the orbital mechanics of the Earth and Moon around the Sun.
Earth Mode (Observer): Shows the moon phase as seen from Earth.
Interactive Controls:
Timeline slider to scrub through the year.
Play/Pause and speed controls (Slow/Medium/Fast).
Educational Content:
Real-time calculation of moon phases (New Moon, Waxing Crescent, Full Moon, etc.).
Dynamic "Smart Tips" that explain phenomena like why the moon glows or tidal locking.
Visual correction to ensure the lit side of the moon always faces the sun.
🚀 Escape Velocity Experiment (/escape)
Status: Placeholder / In Development
Concept: Intended to be an interactive lab to demonstrate escape velocity physics ("How fast do you need to throw a ball to leave Earth?").
Current State: Contains static text and a placeholder div for the canvas/simulation.
🏠 Home Page (/)
Likely contains navigation cards to the various experiments (implied from structure).
5. Observations & Recommendations
Code Quality: The 
MoonPhase.js
 component works well but is quite large (>300 lines). It mixes physics logic, animation loops, and UI rendering.
Refactoring Opportunity: Extract the physics calculations (orbital positions) into a custom hook (e.g., useOrbitalPhysics) to clean up the component.
React 19: The project is using the latest React 19, which is excellent.
Performance: The animation uses requestAnimationFrame, which is the correct approach for smooth simulations.
Next Steps: The 
EscapeVelocity
 module is explicitly marked as "future work" in the code comments. This is a prime candidate for the next development task.
